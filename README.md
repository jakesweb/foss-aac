## Project Mission

The application will be created and distributed as cheaply as possible to help assist at need individuals and the general disabilities population. Everyone deserves a voice and an ability to communicate with their loved ones. Current AAC devices/applications can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to use. The use of the free and open source community will allow us to push forward with the development of these applications in an affordable manner.

## Project Goals

Web services will be used to store user information/configuration in a database that can be accessed from multiple devices using both native applications and a web facing front end. Offline caching will exist for downloaded applications. The application will sync with database changes through a push/pull mechanism. The goal will be allow for editing in real time. The user can create a care network of people that are able to modify their configuration. This will also serve as real-time communication. The application should offer built-in words and phrases and should be able to chain all of these together for sentences. The application should offer touch controls for ease of use. With Android and iOS applications there should also be quick links that can be deployed on device (pending device abilities).

## User Stories

The users can login and find their quick speech on the home page
The users can sync their application across multiple devices
The users can work with care providers to have them assist with setup and usage
The users can use the speech icons to play words/phrases/sentences out-loud
The users can organize their words/phrases/sentences in folders for quick access
